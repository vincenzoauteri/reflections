What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git creates the repository in the directory specified. It creates hidden 
    files that forms the structure and hold the configuration of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    
    The staging area allow us to prepare a commit before actually doing it, allowing
    to select the files we are interested instead of the whole directory. After 
    a commit, it reflects the status of the project to date, and it is useful to
    review the changes from our local files before adding them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    I can add files from the working directory to the stagine area selectievly
    and commit only the set of files representing one logical change. If I have
    more local changes, I can decide to do commits in different stages.
